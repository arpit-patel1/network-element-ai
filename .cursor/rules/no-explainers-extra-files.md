# No Unsolicited Documentation Files

**CRITICAL RULE**: Do NOT create any markdown (.md) files unless the user explicitly requests them.

## Prohibited Actions

- **NEVER** create README.md files automatically
- **NEVER** create documentation files (CHANGELOG.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, etc.) without explicit request
- **NEVER** create explanation files, guide files, or any .md files as "helpful additions"
- **NEVER** suggest or offer to create documentation files unless specifically asked

## When Documentation IS Allowed

- User explicitly says "create a README" or "add documentation"
- User specifically asks for a markdown file by name
- User requests written documentation or guides

## Default Behavior

- Focus on code implementation only
- Provide explanations in chat responses, not in files
- If you think documentation would help, **ask first** rather than creating files

Remember: The user will ask for documentation when they want it. Your job is to write code, not create extra files.
